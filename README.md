# Database-Quarries-Practice
This is showing my skills working on a database, using quarries, and showing the basics that I have practiced in my classes.


## Creating the Database and tables

In the images provided, it shows how I created a simple database with fake information just to practice making a simple database about movie users, watch times and titles watched. 

To create the database I used SQL shell and pgAdmin 4 for the practice. 

In the images I used CREATE DATABASE to create the streaming analytics database. I then accessed the database and created the three tables with the values I needed for my database practice. The tables made were users, movies and watch history.
